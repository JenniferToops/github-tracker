<h1>GITHUB ACCOUNTABILITY TRACKER</h1>
<h2>App that reinforces public accountability for daily pushes to GitHub</h2>
<p>Most developers--especially newer developers--need to get into the habit of pushing to GitHub on a daily basis. This handy app can be shared on teams, between friends, or even for personal use to help build this necessary habit. The ability to "like" other people's pushes can help to further reinforce the routine.</p>
